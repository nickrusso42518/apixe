# Lab builder
This auxiliary project is used to quickly configure the basic MPLS network
using the absolute minimally complex code. You may use this to help with
initial setup once your three routers have management IP addresses and
functional SSH access.

This playbook is *not* an example of well-designed infrastructure as code
because it is the starting point for learning. If it is built with too many
abstractions, it will not be useful as an aid to course setup.
